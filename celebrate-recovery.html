<h3>What is Celebrate Recovery?</h3>

<p>Celebrate Recovery is a Christ-centered program with foundations firmly established in Biblical truth. The 12 Steps with accompanying Scriptures and the 8 Principles based on the Beatitudes offer participants a clear path of salvation and discipleship; bringing hope, freedom, sobriety, healing, and the opportunity to give back one day at a time through our one and only true Higher Power, Jesus Christ.  The 12 Steps and the 8 Principles work seamlessly together, tying historical recovery to timeless Biblical teaching.</p>
